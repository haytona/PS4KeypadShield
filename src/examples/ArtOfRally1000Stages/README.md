# Art of Rally 1,000 stages

**Trophy: if everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough**

## Guide

From the guide: "The best stage to do this on is germany's gonnesweiler and to use either a group s or a car. You need to be going at least 150km/h and aiming for the guard rail between the first yellow and red flags. After that, keep restarting the race."

I've done the experimentation with timing and steering adjustments. I hope these work for you and my settings are below to give you a fighting chance of replicating it.

## Step by step

1. Turn on your PS4 as per normal
1. Navigate to art of rally and start it.
1. Start a "custom rally"
    - location: germany
    - stages: 1
    - ai difficulty: master (doesn't matter)
    - damage level: severe (important as needed to get terminal damage)
1. custom rally: stage 1
    - stage 1: gonnesweiler
    - weather: morning (press square to get next weather until not rain or fog)
1. car/vehicle select
    - group a
    - il gorillona
1. settings > game settings
    - stability assist: 40%
    - counter-steer factor: 100%
    - anti-lock braking 40%
    - transmission automatic
1. begin stage!
    - you can start the script on the begin stage prompt. It expects to start from restart but okay for first time.

## Tweaks

At times, you may find your car crashing into a side barrier rather than hitting terminal damage. Before using the LCDKeypadshield, I needed to unplug the arduino, connect the ps4 controller, press options to return to menu, press and hold ps button on controller to turn it off, plug in arduino. Phew! Too hard, thankfully the keypad shield makes it easier...

In these cases, you can stop the script by pressing "Select" (far left button), then press Left:options, then up or down to get to restart. Then press "select" to start the script again.
