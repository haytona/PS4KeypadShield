**Trophy: if everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough**

## Guide

From the guide: "The best stage to do this on is germany's gonnesweiler and to use either a group s or a car. You need to be going at least 150km/h and aiming for the guard rail between the first yellow and red flags. After that, keep restarting the race."
